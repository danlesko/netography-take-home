# Netography Take Home Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The criteria for the take home assignment can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/netographypublic/react-code-challenge).

The objective was to load information about SpaceX launches into a global redux store, and then use that data to populate a graph. The data needed to be able to be filtered by both ship name, or successful or failed launches, and update the graph accordingly. 


**I wouldn't recommend anyone else completing this take home, after I submitted it I was ignored with no real feedback ever provided.**
